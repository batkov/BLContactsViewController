Are you bored writing UITableViewControllers that looks like standard iOS Contacts page?
Write one delegate method for BLContactsViewController like:

and present it like

```[self.navigationController pushViewController:[BLContactsViewController contactsControllerWithDelegate:self] animated:YES];```
More customization inside.
